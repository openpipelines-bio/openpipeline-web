# Mission

OpenPipelines are best-practice living workflows for single-cell uni- and multi-omics data. Building a best-practice pipeline requires knowledge and time that not one single person can provide, but rather requires input from a community. Additionally, a best-pratice pipeline needs constant maintenance to keep up to date with the latest standards, ideally sourcing input from a 'living' benchmark. Continuous improvement necessitates a robust system for sourcing and applying community input both from a technical and organisational standpoint.
