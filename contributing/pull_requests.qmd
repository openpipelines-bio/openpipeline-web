## Updating your pull request or branch
While creating changes on your local branch, another developper could have added new changes the openpipeline repository.
These changes will need to be included into your local branch before a pull request can be merged. Updating your branch involves merging
the upstream branch (usually `main`) into your branch:

```bash
# download the changes from the openpipelines repo
git fetch upstream
# change your current branch to the branch of the pull request
git checkout <feature_branch>
# merge the changes from upstream into your branch
git merge upstream/main
# push the updates, your pull request will also be updated
git push
```
