## Forking the code and cloning the repository
The OpenPipelines code is hosted on GitHub. To start working on OpenPipelines, you should create your own copy of the repository by forking it. Visit the OpenPipelines repository [here](https://github.com/openpipelines-bio/openpipeline) and use the 'Fork' button on the top right hand side of the page. After you are done forking, you can clone the repository to a local directory on your computer using `git clone`. You can choose between using an SSH key to log in to GitHub or username and password (HTTPS) to connect to github.

## Install `viash` and `nextflow` {#sec-install-viash-nextflow}

To start contributing to OpenPipelines, you will need at [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) (or higher) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system. 

OpenPipelines is being developed in [Viash](https://viash.io/quickstart/) and [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html). If you are unfamiliar with either one of these platforms, you can check out their respective documentation pages.

You can check if is installed correctly by running the following commands.

```bash
nextflow run hello -with-docker
viash --version
```

## Fetch test resources

OpenPipelines uses a number of test resources to test the pipelines. If everything is installed correctly, you should be able to fetch these resources by running the following command.

```bash
viash run src/download/sync_test_resources/config.vsh.yaml
```
