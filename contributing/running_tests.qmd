## Fetch the test data
The input data that is needed to run the tests will need to be downloaded from the openpipelines Amazon AWS s3 bucket first.
To do so, the `download/sync_test_resource` component can be used, which will download the data to the correct location (`resources_test`) by default.

```bash
viash run src/download/sync_test_resources/config.vsh.yaml
```


## Run component tests
To build and run tests for individual component that you are working on, use [viash test](https://viash.io/api/commands/test/) with the `config.vsh.yaml` of the component you would like to test. 
For example:

```bash
viash test src/convert/from_10xh5_to_h5mu/config.vsh.yaml
```
Keep in mind that when no platform is passed to `viash test`, it will use the first platform that is specified in the config, which is `docker` for most of the components in openpipelines. Use `-p native` for example if you do not want to use docker.

It is also possible to execute the tests for all components in each namespace using:

```bash
viash ns test --parallel -q convert
```

## Run integration tests
Individual integration tests can be run by using the `integration_test.sh` scripts for a pipeline, located next to the `main.nf` in the `src/workflows` folder.

```bash
src/workflows/ingestion/cellranger_demux/integration_test.sh
```
